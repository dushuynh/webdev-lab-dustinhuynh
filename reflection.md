## Reflection Document

### HTML

The list activity was very straightforward. I only had to look at help for the href part of the exercise. The image exercise was also very straightforward. The table one I had trouble with the last two rows of the table, but sorted it out relatively quickly. The form one was definitely a bit more complex. For this one I had to follow the video pretty closely to get it functioning properly. Overall this section was really good for practicing the basics and getting some reps in. I think they were a good appropriate length and I wouldn't change much about it.
