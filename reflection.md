## Reflection Document

### 01-html

The list activity was very straightforward. I only had to look at help for the href part of the exercise. The image exercise was also very straightforward. The table one I had trouble with the last two rows of the table, but sorted it out relatively quickly. The form one was definitely a bit more complex. For this one I had to follow the video pretty closely to get it functioning properly. Overall this section was really good for practicing the basics and getting some reps in. I think they were a good appropriate length and I wouldn't change much about it.

### 02-a11y

This section was very short. It only had the form exercise for accessibility. I think this exercise isn't super helpful if you followed the video for the previous form exercise because that exercise sort of already covers all of these ideas. It feels like a repeat, just with some things in place for you already. I also wished there were some other accessibility exercises, not just this form one. There could have been an image one, etc.

### 03-css

The selectors exercise in this section was a little confusing. I had to closely follow the video for this. While it is good practice, I feel like this exercise isn't very realistic. The second exercise was the opposite of tricky, and was honestly way too easy. The specificity exercise was good and straightforward. The layout one was a little confusing at first, but the video helped. Positions exercise was good, bit of a discrepency with the top and bottom height, but I just ignored it. For the last one, I basically just followed the video one for one. The video for this one is sort of tedious. This exercise feels almost like a navbar exercise rather than a media query one. Overall this section was useful and covered a good range of topics. 

### 04-flexbox

This flexbox activity was good. The video for it was good and straight to the point. I did try them on my own at first but ended up following the video when it got a bit difficult to do without looking too many things up. Overall good exercise.

### 05-css-grid

These two grid exercises were really good. I followed the video from the start because I wasn't very familiar with grid. The exercises were helpful with learning the basics as well as some tricks with it. I wouldn't change anything.

### 06-bootstrap

Not sure why, but the instructions didn't work for me so I fully followed the videos. The first exercise is good. I thought it was a little weird to copy paste the base of the code, but it covers the basics fine. For the grid exercise it was very easy and somewhat similar to the css grid. The second grid exercise was good and its cool seeing a different way of making it responsive. The modal exercise was fine, but the video was a little messy. It was still useful though. I think more bootstrap functionality could have been shown, but I think it covered a good amount.

### 07-javascript

The first exercise was very straight forward and simple. Same for the second and third exercise. The fourth one was pretty tricky and I had to follow the video. The fifth one is pretty simple but actually very very useful. For the fetch activity it was very complicated and I actually couldn't get it to work even following the video. I likely have a typo somewhere and couldn't find it. The last one wasn't as bad, but I also had to basically follow the video one for one because I wasn't familiar with it. While I think there could've been more covered, this section had some good quirks with javascript learned.
