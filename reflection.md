## Reflection Document

The list activity was very straightforward. I only had to look at help for the href part of the exercise. The image exercise was also very straightforward. The table one I had trouble with the last two rows of the table, but sorted it out relatively quickly. The form one was definitely a bit more complex. For this one I had to follow the video pretty closely to get it functioning properly. Overall this section was really good for practicing the basics and getting some reps in. I think they were a good appropriate length and I wouldn't change much about it.

This section was very short. It only had the form exercise for accessibility. I think this exercise isn't super helpful if you followed the video for the previous form exercise because that exercise sort of already covers all of these ideas. It feels like a repeat, just with some things in place for you already. I also wished there were some other accessibility exercises, not just this form one. There could have been an image one, etc.
